Chuchart is a work-in-progress CHUNITHM chart viewer in WebGL2 (OpenGL ES 3.0).<br>
Do not get any ideas. This is NOT in any way related to AquaDX... I swear. :wink:

## TODO

### Now

- Add gold notes (asset)
- Add airs (handler, shader)
- Add flicks (handler, assets, shader)
- Add effects (handler, assets, shader)
- Parse charting (@nbitzz's responsibility, probably, tbd)
- Implement howler.js

### After

- Tidy up shaders (renaming variables to be more or less legible, etc.)
- Tidy up handlers and base
- Abstract base to be compatible with future game chart viewers
- Remove glMatrix (perspective matrix can be hardcoded, less dependencies is better)
- Build shader package using pako? tbd

### Future

- Mai2 chart viewer too? Probably (WINK WINK WINK)
